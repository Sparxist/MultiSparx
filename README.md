# ✨ Multiple-instance Sparx! ✨
A tool that allows multiple instances of Sparx to be opened, without the annoying "Looks like you've logged in somewhere else" message.

## Installation
- Install the Tampermonkey extension ([Chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)). 
- Go to the Tampermonkey extension, and click `Create a new script...`
- Copy the text in the `multiSparx.js` file above.
- Select all of the existing code and paste the code and hit Ctrl-S/⌘-S to save. The program will run automatically.
